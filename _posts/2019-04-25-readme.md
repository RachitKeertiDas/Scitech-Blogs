## Guidelines to create a new post:
To create a new post, follow the given steps:

1. Write your post in markdown
2. Make sure to have different paragraphs in your post 
3. The front matter of your post should look similar to the following:
```
    ---
    layout:post
    club: "your-club"
    header-line <optional>: "To be displayed below the headline"
    ---
```
4. Save your file in the _posts directory in the format `yyyy-mm-dd-title.md`

### Additional Notes:
In case you want to have an image at the top of your post, *DO NOT* attach the image on the top of the post. Instead, 
add it in front-matter as `hero_image:"your file here"`
